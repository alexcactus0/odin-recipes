            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        </div>
            <ul>
                <li>1 (4 pound) chicken, cut into pieces</li>
                <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
                <li>2 cups all-purpose flour for coating</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
                <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
                <li>2 quarts vegetable oil for frying</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Steps</h3>
        </div>
    <ol>
        <p><li>Take your cut up chicken pieces and skin them if you prefer.</li></p>
        <p><li>Place flour in a large plastic bag (let the amount of chicken <br>
            you are cooking dictate the amount of flour you use). Season flour <br>
            with paprika (which helps to brown the chicken), salt and pepper.</li></p>
        <p><li>Dip chicken pieces in buttermilk then, a few at a time, transfer them into<br>
            the bag with flour; seal the bag and shake to coat well.</li></p>
        <p><li>Place the coated chicken on a cookie sheet or tray, and cover with<br>
            a clean dish towel or waxed paper. LET SIT UNTIL THE FLOUR IS OF<br>A PASTE-LIKE CONSISTENCY.
            THIS IS CRUCIAL!</li></p>
        <p><li>Fill a large skillet (cast iron is best) about 1/3 to 1/2 full with vegetable oil.<br>
            Heat until VERY hot.</li></p>
        <p><li>Put in as many chicken pieces as the skillet can hold. Brown the chicken in HOT<br>
            oil on both sides.</li></p>
        <p><li>When browned, reduce heat and cover skillet; let cook for 30 minutes<br>
            (the chicken will be cooked through but not crispy). Remove cover, raise heat again,<br>
            and continue to fry until crispy.</li></p>
       <p><li>Drain fried chicken on paper towels. Depending on how much chicken you have,<br>
            you may have to fry in a few shifts. Keep the finished chicken in a slightly warm<br>
            oven while preparing the rest.</li></p>
