# Odin Recipes

This is a beginner project from The Odin Project curriculum.  
In this project, I am building a simple website that displays a few recipes using only HTML.

## Project Goals

The main purpose of this project is to practice and demonstrate the following skills:

- Understanding the basic structure of an HTML document
- Creating and linking multiple HTML pages
- Using common HTML elements like headings, paragraphs, images, lists, and links
- Working with Git and GitHub (cloning a repository, making commits, pushing changes)
- Navigating and managing files using the command line

## Reflection

By the end of this project, I will have a solid understanding of how to create a basic static website and how to use Git as a version control system. This is my first step toward becoming more comfortable with web development tools and workflows.
